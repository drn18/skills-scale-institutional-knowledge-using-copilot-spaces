## Purpose
Ensure smooth handoff from UX Design to Development with all necessary design specifications, assets, and context.

## Pre-handoff Requirements
- [ ] Design has been reviewed and approved by stakeholders
- [ ] User research findings documented and shared
- [ ] Accessibility requirements identified and documented
- [ ] Design aligns with existing design system or includes new component specs

## Design Deliverables Checklist

### Visual Design
- [ ] High-fidelity mockups for all screen states (default, hover, active, disabled, error)
- [ ] Mobile and responsive breakpoint designs (if applicable)
- [ ] Dark mode designs (if applicable)

- [ ] Copy and microcopy finalized
- [ ] Links to relevant user research or testing results

## Handoff Meeting
- [ ] Schedule handoff meeting with development team
- [ ] Walk through designs and answer questions
- [ ] Discuss technical feasibility and constraints
- [ ] Agree on implementation timeline
- [ ] Establish review checkpoints during development

## During Development
- [ ] Available for developer questions and clarifications
- [ ] Review implementation in progress (at agreed checkpoints)
- [ ] Provide feedback on design fidelity
- [ ] Sign off on final implementation before QA

## Post-implementation
- [ ] Conduct final design QA review
- [ ] Document any deviations from original design
- [ ] Update design system if new patterns were created
- [ ] Participate in usability testing (if planned)
